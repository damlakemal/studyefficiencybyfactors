# Studying Efficiency / Productivity by Factors

## Project Overview 

In this project i aim to analyze how some factors in my life change or affect my studying efficiency. I will record daily data of several factors like my **sleep schedule**, **screen time**, **caffeine intake** and my **study duration** as well as the **productivity score** of that study session. 
Using these datasets my goal is to figure out how these factors corralate and affect my study rime and productivity. 


## My Motivation 

As a student I always want to improve my productivity. I always assumed my sleep schedule, caffeine intake and my screentime affected my productivity, but I never had data to prove it.
In this project I aim to find how each factor affects my productivity. 
Ultimately, I hope to find the "optimal routine" to make the best and most productive studying periods. 


## Data Collection 
  I will collect data daily by recording my **sleeping and waking times**, **every coffe I drink** (including where I got it from), and the **number of hours I study**, together with a self rated productivity score.
  In addition I will collect my screentime data from my phone, computer, and iPad to analyze which apps and categories i spend most time each day.
